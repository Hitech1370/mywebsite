              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p>I arrived in Canada in 2016 and completed my studies in “Computer Systems Technician” in 2018. I secured a job at Amazon as an “IT Support Technician” in 2019 
                and was responsible for launching the YOW1 warehouse in Ottawa. I received my first promotion in December 2019. In 2020, I began to learn about 
                "AWS Solutions Architect" while leading the launch of another warehouse (YOW3) as the primary leader. After a year, I received my second promotion 
                but decided to pursue a career in the Cloud world. I searched for a job and was offered a role as a Solutions Architect - Specialist at Bell.
                 I now work with various public cloud services such as GCP, AWS, and Azure. I have also started teaching "AWS Solutions Architect"ince 2023 at Anisa Institution.</p>
